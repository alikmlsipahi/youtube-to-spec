# Implementation Plan — Progress Checklist

> Living, crash-resilient build tracker for `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.md` (authoritative; v1 superseded).
> One line per catalog id. `state ∈ pending | spec | test-written | code-written | green | accepted`.
> Authoring rows (Phase C) use the simpler lifecycle `pending | drafted | accepted` (no unit tests).
> Rules: advance a row **only on real evidence** (tests actually run). **Never** copy assertion
> text into this file (keeps the blind-TDD barrier intact). On resume, continue from the first
> non-`green` row. In-session, mirror rows as Task items for live visibility; this file is the
> durable source of truth.

## Skill 1 — `youtube-artifact-collector` (unit / blind-TDD)

- [green] T-S1-01 — extract_video_id
- [green] T-S1-02 — format_timestamp
- [green] T-S1-03 — classify_input
- [green] T-S1-04 — slugify / collection_dir_name
- [green] T-S1-05 — build_video_block
- [green] T-S1-06 — select_transcript_track
- [green] T-S1-07 — build_segments
- [green] T-S1-08 — render_markdown
- [green] T-S1-09 — build_manifest
- [green] T-S1-10 — parse_hidden_unavailable
- [green] T-S1-11 — graceful degradation (fetch_metadata)
- [accepted] T-S1-12 — request_delay (jittered inter-request sleep) — verified: test_request_delay.py 10/10, full skill-1 suite 132/132, no regressions; end-to-end live-run verification below (SK1-ORCH v2.2)
- [accepted] T-S1-13 — artifact_basename / common_title_prefix — **[v2.1] naming policy, retrofitted coverage.** 38 cases green. Spec authored from documented policy + signatures/docstrings only (no bodies); tests authored from spec only (no implementation) — so green means the code matches its documented contract, not that the tests match the code. Zero divergences. Guard proven: dropping the pad floor to one digit fails 4 cases.
- [accepted] T-S1-14 — scan_existing — same retrofit route; 24 cases green, zero divergences. Guard proven: removing the `_manifest.json` / `*.requirements.json` exclusion fails 2 cases. Full skill-1 suite 132 → 196.

## Skill 2 — `feature-requirement-extractor` (unit / blind-TDD)

- [green] T-S2-01 — config resolution (CLI > env > default)
- [green] T-S2-02 — fill_prompt
- [green] T-S2-03 — parse_response / render
- [green] T-S2-04 — validate_req_id
- [green] T-S2-05 — composite-key uniqueness
- [green] T-S2-06 — env key loading
- [green] T-S2-07 — input resolution

## Orchestration (non-blind glue; no unit test — integration-gated)

> Additive `main()`/CLI/IO + new glue functions wiring the green helpers into an
> end-to-end flow. Existing functions untouched; verified via the integration gates
> below, not unit tests.
>
> **[2026-07-15]** This "glue needs no unit test" framing cost us: `artifact_basename`,
> `common_title_prefix` and `scan_existing` landed here under it, but the first two are
> *pure functions* carrying the entire [v2.1] naming policy — so when v2.1 changed that
> policy, nothing in any tier objected and I-01 sat red unnoticed. They are now real units
> (T-S1-13/14). The rule to draw: **glue is the I/O and wiring, not every function that
> arrives with it** — a pure function belongs in the unit tier no matter which phase adds it.

- [done] SK1-ORCH — extract_artifacts.py main/CLI/IO + enumerate_playlist/fetch_transcript/build_artifact/write_* (verified by I-01 ✓, I-02 ✓)
  - [done] **[v2.1]** title-derived artifact filenames — `artifact_basename` re-signed + `common_title_prefix` / `scan_existing` added; `--skip-existing` now resolves via the on-disk id index. `slugify`/`collection_dir_name` (T-S1-04) untouched, so no blind-TDD chain was re-opened. Re-verified: real playlist → `01-tek-tek-ogrenci-yukleme.json` … `19-…`, manifest `summary` unchanged (24/19 ok/5 failed), `--skip-existing` second pass skipped 19 in 0.09s (no network); 247 unit tests green.
  - [done] **[v2.2]** jittered `--sleep-requests` moved to fire before every network-hitting iteration (except the first), gated on a `hit_network` flag; old unconditional end-of-loop sleep removed. Built on new pure helper `request_delay` (T-S1-12, blind-TDD, green: 10/10 own tests, 132/132 full skill-1 suite). Re-verified live: two invalid ids w/ `--sleep-requests 3` → 5.955s then 5.610s on a repeat run (metadata_failed pays the delay now; jitter varies run to run, not fixed); real single-video collect unaffected (3.276s, one network call, no sleep); `--skip-existing` w/ `--sleep-requests 30` still 0.101s (no network → free); default path (no `--sleep-requests`) unchanged at 3.242s.
- [done] SK2-ORCH — extract_requirements.py main/CLI + OpenAI engine (load_prompt_files/build_response_format/call_openai/process_artifact/write_outputs) (verified by I-03 ✓; claude-path ✓)
  - [done] **[v2.1]** `write_outputs` names outputs after the source artifact's basename instead of `video.id`, keeping Skill 1 the only owner of naming policy; `SKILL.md` step 6 re-authored to match so both engines agree. Re-verified: `01-tek-tek-ogrenci-yukleme.requirements.{json,md}`; `resolve_inputs` still resolves all 19 members via the manifest.

## Authoring (Phase C — non-blind; prose/assets; test-denylist still applies)

> Lifecycle: pending → drafted → accepted. Accepted at the mapped acceptance gate.

- [accepted] SK1-DOC — youtube-artifact-collector/SKILL.md (Phase C1; gate A-01)
- [accepted] SK2-ASSETS — Skill 2 prompts/{system_prompt,extraction_prompt}.md, templates/requirement_doc.md, .env.example (Phase C2; gates A-03, A-04)
- [accepted] SK2-DOC — feature-requirement-extractor/SKILL.md (Phase C3; gates A-02, A-03)

## Integration tier (`@pytest.mark.integration`, opt-in)

- [green] I-01 — Skill 1 real fl1DSmwQKKY → metadata + title-derived artifact on disk. Split in two (2026-07-15): `writes_titled_artifact` **passes** (verified: `_singles/what-is-claude-code.json` + `.md`, `video.id` matches, basename is the title slug not the id); `fetches_transcript` **skips** from this network — YouTube `IpBlocked` on transcript fetch, so `available_tracks=[en auto]` is read but `transcript.available:false`. Skip ≠ pass: it runs for real on an unblocked network, and zero caption tracks would still fail.
  - **[correction 2026-07-15]** This row previously claimed `60 tr auto segments … available_tracks=[tr]`. That evidence does not describe `fl1DSmwQKKY` ("What is Claude Code?"), which exposes exactly one `en` auto track — measured directly. The claim predates `2bceaa9` swapping in this public video, and the gate was never re-run against it; the stale evidence rode along on the new id. Replaced with what is actually verifiable here.
- [green] I-02 — Skill 1 real playlist → hidden_unavailable_count:5, members ordered 1..24, 19 ok / 5 metadata_failed w/ reason (verified)
- [green] I-03 — Skill 2 OpenAI real key → same JSON/MD shape parsed (json_schema; valid ids, composite-unique; model trace accuracy is model-side, not script)

## Acceptance-only (prompt-following & trigger behavior)

- [accepted] A-01 — Skill 1 SKILL.md fires on "collect artifacts for this playlist" (trigger + flag audit vs argparse: exact match)
- [accepted] A-02 — Skill 2 SKILL.md fires on "extract requirements from this artifact" (trigger + flag audit vs argparse: exact match)
- [accepted] A-03 — Claude-native engine yields filled doc: 18 reqs, valid ids, all traces resolve to real segments
- [accepted] A-04 — Swapping extraction_prompt.md changes model prompt with zero code edit (git status of script empty)
